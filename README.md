# libft
It's my first training project at 21 school. Goal is write own library on C language, that compile with GNU Makefile. 
In this library we recode basic functions from <string.h>, and few functions from <stdlib.h> and <ctype.h>. 
Also in second part of this project we have to code more difficult functions like "ft_split", 
that split string by delimiter and return malloced two-dimensional array of split strings
or like "ft_strjoin", that concatenate two strings (return a new malloced string).
